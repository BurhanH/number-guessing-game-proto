# number-guessing-game-proto

NOTE! I get code (JavaScript, CSS, and HTML page) and made modifications in JavaScript file.

Modifications:
1) Added helper functions (each function with description is new code) <br>
2) Rearranged some variables and lines of code <br>
3) Made integration between this repository and Heroku web server (if some changes go to master branch this action automatically redeploy web application with new changes) <br>
